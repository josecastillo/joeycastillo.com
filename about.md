#Apps

Joey began [developing apps](/apps) for the iPhone in 2009. Formerly a Senior Software Engineer at Accenture and a Mobile Application Developer at American Express Publishing, he's currently pursuing independent projects in Brooklyn, NY. 

Previous independent projects include [Dictapad](/apps/dictapad), the best-in-class transcription aid for the iPad, as well as [Bushwick Open Studios](/apps/openstudios), an annual event program for the three-day arts festival in Brooklyn, New York. 

#In the Community

In 2012 Joey co-founded the [reddit community /r/ainbow](http://reddit.com/r/ainbow) as an open discussion space for LGBT issues among gender and sexual minorities. Under the guidance of the founding team, /r/ainbow grew to a subscribed base of over 20,000 members in a year's time — 90% of whom, according to a survey, identified as a gender or sexual minority. 

In 2011, he assisted Donna DeCesare with her [Audience Engagement Grant in El Salvador](http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/documentary-photography-project/grantees/donna-de-cesare), teaching photography and photo editing skills and providing technical guidance for the [MemoriArte](http://www.memoriarte.org) project that exhibited the students' stories. 

#Older Work

He was also the sole ActionScript developer behind photojournalist Donna DeCesare's powerful website [Destiny's Children: A Legacy of Gangs and War](http://www.destinyschildren.org/).
