The Bushwick Open Studios app is an annual event program for the three-day summer arts festival held in Brooklyn. It is comprised of both a Flask backend for serving schedule data, and a native iPhone client for viewing the schedules and events. The app averages 3,000 downloads each year. 

Described by arts blog Hyperallergic as "[one of the biggest annual art events in New York](http://hyperallergic.com/204640/how-arts-in-bushwick-has-stayed-on-mission-in-a-rapidly-changing-neighborhood/)", Bushwick Open Studios encompasses more than 500 events at more than 200 sites throughout the Bushwick neighborhood. The BOS app incorporates an interactive neighborhood map to help the thousands of festivalgoers navigate the event. The app also includes robust search functionality, and features that allow users to build their own schedule of events and spaces they wish to visit.
