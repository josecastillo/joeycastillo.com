Your Flowing Data Uploader functioned as a simple front-end for Your Flowing Data, a very cool self-surveillance application by Nathan Yau. It stored users' commonly used shortcuts, and then used the Twitter API to send this information directly to YFD.

Your Flowing Data Uploader was launched in the summer of 2009 for iOS 2.0, and received regular updates to support new iOS features like Core Data in iOS 3.0, and Fast App Switching and the Retina Display in iOS 4.0. It also received regular updates to support Twitter API changes as they came down the pike.
