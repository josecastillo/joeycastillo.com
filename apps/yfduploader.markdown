#yfduploader

Your Flowing Data Uploader functions as a simple front-end for Your Flowing Data, a very cool self-surveillance application by Nathan Yau. It stores users' commonly used shortcuts, and then uses the Twitter API to send this information directly to YFD.

Your Flowing Data Uploader was discontinued in 2012 due to changes in the Twitter API.

##History

Your Flowing Data Uploader was launched in the summer of 2009, and has received regular updates to support new iOS features like Core Data in iOS 3.0, and Fast App Switching and the Retina Display in iOS 4.0. It was also recently updated to support the new (and mandatory) Twitter OAuth protocol, maintaining seamless compatibility for the app's users.

##Technologies Used

It's a simple app, but it's no slouch. Actions are stored using **Core Data** for super-fast launch times. **Core Animation** allows for subtle flourishes, like the animation that occurs when data is sent. UI elements were designed with **resolution independence** in mind, which means the app was Retina Display ready in a matter of hours, not days.
