Before getting into mobile apps, I received my **M.A. in Journalism from the University of Texas at Austin** in 2011, with a focus on photojournalism. Mostly to avoid breaking old permalinks, I've kept handful of projects from that era archived here. 

* [The Outcomes Project](/multimedia/outcomes), 2011, my Master's Report. Full text available by request. 
* [Daily](/video/daily), 2008, documentary video project. 
* [Proposition 8 in Austin](/video/proposition-8-in-austin), 2008, news video.
* [Still Photography](/stills)
